# Prototype
* Allows cloning objects, even complex ones, without coupling to their specific classes.
* All prototype classes should have a common interface that makes it possible to copy objects even if their concrete classes are unknown.
* Prototype objects can produce full copies since objects of the same class can access each other’s private fields.

Note
Usage examples: The Prototype pattern is available in C# out of the box with a ICloneable interface.

Identification: The prototype can be easily recognized by a clone or copy methods, etc.
